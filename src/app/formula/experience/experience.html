            Few have shaped the world of motorsport innovation like Jack Heuer. A true pioneer, his visionary approach
            revolutionized sponsorships and partnerships, setting new standards in the industry. Beginning with his
            groundbreaking
            collaboration with Ferrari in 1971, and later forging legendary alliances with McLaren (1986-2015), Jack
            Heuer’s influence
            helped redefine racing’s golden age. His leadership also brought TAG Heuer to the forefront as the Official
            Timekeeper of
            Formula 1 from 1992 to 2003, laying the foundation for partnerships that continue to inspire and innovate
            today.
